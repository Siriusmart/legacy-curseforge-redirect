# Legacy CurseForge Redirect

[Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/legacy-curseforge-redirect)

Dislike CurseForge's redesign? Legacy CurseForge Redirect will ensure that you always load the legacy (legacy.curseforge.com) design instead.

Will force all curseforge.com usage to legacy.curseforge.com. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in private windows.

As well as remove the "go to the new website" button.

#### Redirected domains

- `curseforge.com`
- `www.curseforge.com`
